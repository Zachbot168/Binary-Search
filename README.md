Linear Search versus Binary Search
When refering to a "Search" we are searching for something in a sorted list or array. There are many purposes these searches can be used for, for searching for data points and in many algorithms require one to search through many points of data. Here I will compare a linear search versus a binary search, what each are and which is better. 

Linear Search
A linear search can be thought of as trying to find a book in a library that has their books sorted alphabetically and starting at the books that start with A and going down checking one by one all the way down until you reach Z or find the book you're looking for

Binary Search
A binary search can be thought about as looking to find a book in a library with books sorted alphabetically and starting with the middle letter, the 13th letter of the alphabet and checking if the book you want is above it or below it. You repeat this process of going to the middle letter of the remaining letters until you find the book you're looking for

Which is better?
When looking at an efficiency standpoint the binary search is much more efficient, as its other name is a "logarithmic search". This mean that as the amount of data points increase the efficiency that one can find what they're looking for increases at only a logarithmic rate, while as the data points in a linear search increases the difficulty increases at a linear rate, much worse and less efficient than a binary search.
This is why I decided to create a binary search algorithm, the algorithm you will be seeing below.
